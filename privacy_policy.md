## Privacy Policy

Christian Rowlands built the Network Survey app as an Open Source app. This App is provided by Christian Rowlands at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use the App.

WE DO NOT STORE ANY DATA.  PERIOD.

We physically can’t.  We have nowhere to store it.  We don’t even have a server database to store it.

**Log Data**

The App does have the capability to log information to a GeoPackage file, but that file remains on your device and it is up to you if you want to copy the file off the device to another device of your choosing.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
